6. What kind of error will Maven throw during mvn install? How do you debug such XML mistakes? -2M
Answer: Maven will throw XML parsing errors like "The markup in the document following the root element must be well-formed" or "Element type mismatch."
How to debug:

Check XML structure in IDE (Eclipse shows red underlines)
Use mvn validate to check POM syntax
Look at the Problems view in Eclipse


7. You written like this <pakng> tag in the POM. What does Maven assume by default, and what impact will it have on this web project? -2M
Answer: Maven assumes jar packaging by default. For a web project, this should be <packaging>war</packaging>.
Impact: The project won't create a deployable web archive (WAR file), causing deployment issues.

8. Currently only JUnit is included. If the project needs to connect to MySQL, what dependency would you add? -2M
Answer:
xml<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.33</version>
</dependency>

9. How can I add the JQuery 3.6.1 dependency to your project. Check how it works? -3M
Answer:
xml<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>jquery</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.1</version>
</dependency>
How it works: WebJars packages client-side libraries as JAR files for easy Maven dependency management.

10. Identify the <artifactId> is written correct or not. How will this affect your generated jar, and how would you fix it? -2M
Answer: If misspelled, it affects the generated JAR filename and project identification. Fix by correcting the spelling to match your project name.

11. You are required to change the default build output directory from target/ to build_output/. How would you configure it in pom.xml? -2M
Answer:
xml<build>
    <directory>build_output</directory>
</build>

12. Add JUnit dependency of JUnit - 4.13-beta-2 to your existing project check the complete pom xml file and run it. -3M
Answer: Replace existing JUnit with:
xml<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.13-beta-2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

13. Push the updated project into GitHub of your account using maven gitbash environment and check? -3M
Answer: Commands in Git Bash:
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Updated Maven configuration"
git push origin main

Now shall we apply all these fixes to create a complete, working pom.xml file?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Syou forgot one question in between. 10 one in the screenshot i sentEditYou're absolutely right! I missed question 10 from the second screenshot. Let me provide the complete answer for that question:
10. Inside your pom.xml, locate the <build> section. Then, add or modify the <directory> tag to specify the new output directory, which in this case is build_output/ -2M
Answer: Add or modify the build section in pom.xml:
xml<build>
    <directory>build_output</directory>
    <plugins>
        <!-- your existing plugins -->
    </plugins>
</build>
Explanation: The <directory> tag inside <build> section changes Maven's default output directory from target/ to build_output/. All compiled classes, generated JARs, and build artifacts will be placed in the build_output/ folder instead of the default target/ folder.

So the corrected question 11 is:
11. You are required to change the default build output directory from target/ to build_output/. How would you configure it in pom.xml? -2M
Answer: This is the same as question 10 - use the <directory>build_output</directory> tag inside the <build> section.

Now we have all questions answered! Shall we:

Create a complete, corrected pom.xml with all the fixes
Test it with mvn clean compile
Make sure everything works together?

Let me know and I'll provide the complete fixed pom.xml file!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.S

All done! These are the standard Git commands you'd use for each scenario. 🎯RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Sgive me answers for these and explain wellEditDocker Containerization for Maven JAVA Application - 20M
Task: Containerize your Maven project using Docker

a. Refer the given link/documentation to write a Dockerfile for the Maven project.
b. https://github.com/Kumbhambhargavi75/CampusMgmtSystem/
c. Ensure it copies the WAR/JAR and runs on Tomcat (or relevant base image)
Answer:Dockerfile for Maven Java ApplicationCode # Multi-stage build for Maven Java Web Application
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17 AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml first for better caching
COPY pom.xml .

# Download dependencies (cached if pom.xml doesn't change)
RUN mvn Explanation: This Dockerfile uses multi-stage build - first stage compiles Maven project, second stage runs it on Tomcat. This reduces final image size by excluding build tools.

1. Check the docker version and list all the images existing
Answer:
bash# Check Docker version
docker --version

# List all Docker images
docker images
# OR
docker image ls
Explanation: docker --version shows installed Docker version. docker images displays all local images with repository, tag, image ID, creation date, and size.

2. How can you pull the hello world image from locally and run it.
Answer:
bash# Pull hello-world image
docker pull hello-world

# Run the hello-world image
docker run hello-world
Explanation: docker pull downloads image from Docker Hub to local machine. docker run creates and starts a container from the image.

3. How do you Pull the image ubuntu and work interactive mode?
Answer:
bash# Pull Ubuntu image
docker pull ubuntu

# Run Ubuntu in interactive mode
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
Explanation: -it flag combines -i (interactive) and -t (pseudo-TTY), allowing you to interact with the container's shell. /bin/bash starts bash shell inside container.

4. Write a Dockerfile to create an image name as CSIMAGE for your Maven-based CampusMgmtSystem application. Ensure the image can build and run your Java application consistently.
Answer:
dockerfile# Build stage
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Runtime stage
FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk17-openjdk
LABEL maintainer="campus-mgmt-system"
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/campus.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
Build command:
bashdocker build -t csimage .
Explanation: Creates custom image named "csimage" that packages your Maven application with Tomcat for consistent deployment across environments.

5. Pull the official image from Docker Hub, run it in a container and list of containers that are running.
Answer:
bash# Pull official image (example: nginx)
docker pull nginx:latest

# Run in detached mode
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a
Explanation: -d runs container in background (detached). -p 8080:80 maps host port 8080 to container port 80. docker ps shows active containers.

6. How can you start and stop a running container
Answer:
bash# Stop a running container
docker stop container_name_or_id

# Start a stopped container
docker start container_name_or_id

# Restart a container
docker restart container_name_or_id
Explanation: docker stop gracefully stops container (sends SIGTERM). docker start resumes stopped container. docker restart stops and starts container.

7. How can you check a list of all containers, including stopped ones.
Answer:
bash# List all containers (running + stopped)
docker ps -a

# List only running containers
docker ps

# List containers with custom format
docker ps -a --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
Explanation: -a flag shows all containers regardless of status. Without -a, only running containers are shown.

8. How can you stop a running container
Answer:
bash# Graceful stop (sends SIGTERM, waits, then SIGKILL)
docker stop container_name

# Forceful stop (immediate SIGKILL)
docker kill container_name

# Stop multiple containers
docker stop container1 container2

# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
Explanation: docker stop allows 10 seconds for graceful shutdown. docker kill immediately terminates the container process.

9. Push your custom Docker image (with the deployed application) to your Docker Hub account and make it available publicly
Answer:
bash# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Tag your image with your Docker Hub username
docker tag csimage yourusername/csimage:latest

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push yourusername/csimage:latest

# Make repository public (done via Docker Hub website)
# Go to hub.docker.com → Repositories → csimage → Settings → Make Public
Explanation: You must tag image with your Docker Hub username before pushing. Login required for push operations. Public repositories are accessible to everyone.

10. How do you check whether a container exited cleanly or crashed?
Answer:
bash# Check container status and exit code
docker ps -a

# View container logs
docker logs container_name

# Inspect container for detailed information
docker inspect container_name

# Check specific exit code
docker inspect --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}' container_name
Exit codes:

0: Clean exit (success)
1: General error
125: Docker daemon error
126: Container command not executable
127: Container command not found
137: Container killed (SIGKILL)

Explanation: Exit code 0 means clean shutdown. Non-zero codes indicate errors. Logs provide details about what went wrong. docker inspect gives comprehensive container information including exit status.
